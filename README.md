I personally find it easiest to solve Codewar problems by writing the code in Visual Studio.  This allows me find errors faster, use TDD when applicable, and have an easier way to track my work.  I have placed each Codewar problem inside a #region so they can easily be closed to keep my code cleaner.  I enjoy the challenge of Codewars and the range of difficulty that is available.
